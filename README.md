## üìë Business Understanding
**DiTenun - Ulos Image Classification**

DiTenun is an organization dedicated to the preservation and promotion of Indonesia‚Äôs traditional woven fabrics, particularly Ulos, a cultural heritage of the Batak community. With its primary role in digitizing and showcasing Ulos motifs to a wider audience, DiTenun seeks to integrate modern technology into the traditional sector. However, one major challenge lies in the vast variety of Ulos motifs, each with intricate patterns, colors, and details, making manual identification and classification a time-consuming and labor-intensive process.

To address this challenge, the development of an image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is crucial for automatically categorizing Ulos motifs based on the available dataset of Ulos images. This classification model aims to enhance the speed and accuracy of motif identification, supporting cultural preservation efforts and making Ulos motifs more accessible to the public, artisans, and researchers. This initiative aligns with DiTenun‚Äôs mission to promote and sustain Ulos heritage effectively through modern technological advancements.
